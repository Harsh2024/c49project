<p>
Chameleons actually change their colour due to a number of different factors, including their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment.

<p>
Cicadas are mostly beneficial. They prune mature trees, aerate the soil, and once they die, their bodies serve as an important source of nitrogen for growing trees.

<p>
Grizzly bears possess a biting force of over 1200 PSI, which is enough to crush a bowling ball or an iron skillet.
